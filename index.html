       <p>link to cookie recipe project></p>
        <p>In my time here at Moringa,I have been able complete the following projects,
          <div class="tropical">
        <ul>
         <li>My Portfolio.</li>
            <p span class="john">This project was basically about making my portfolio landing page which will be looked up by people other than me to know what I have been able to do so far.I will also be dropping a link after this paragrapgh to enable anyone interested in knowing my progress.I typically just used HTML 5 to write the code then styled it using CSS.</p>
        <li>A cookie recipe.</li>
            <p>The cookie recipe was not really a project but more of practise to enable we,the students correct various errors from indentation,spacing and correcting the misplaced tags in the html file and committing the file to Github through Git.The code was again still written in HTML 5 and styled using CSS.The students after correcting the various errors at certain set points had to call the TM(technical mentors) to confirm the exercise as done well.</p>
            <li>A project on news articles</li>
            </ul>
